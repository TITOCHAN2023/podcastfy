<Person1> "Welcome to PODCASTIFY  - Your Personal Generative AI Podcast. Wow, listeners, we've got a powerhouse resume on our hands today! This Chen Zhanpeng is packing some serious heat!" 
</Person1><Person2> "Heat is right! This isn't just a resume, it's a launchpad. Look at that GPA – 3.55/4.50, top 20% in IoT Engineering at Shenzhen Technology University?  Impressive!" 
</Person2><Person1> "And the skills? Python, Golang, C/C++, Linux, Docker... it's like a checklist of everything you'd want in a rising tech star.  Plus, the experience isn't just theoretical. This guy's built real stuff." 
</Person1><Person2> "That's what grabbed my attention. This 'Open Source Large Model Real-time Interaction System' – he built his own LLaMa 3 and Qwen 2.5 models?  And integrated a knowledge base using Neo4j?  This isn't just textbook learning, it's application, innovation!" 
</Person2><Person1> "Totally! And it's not just big, complex projects. He's also tackled practical problems like the 'Small Fast Conference Platform' with Golang and Python, and a smart streetlight system with Python and MQTT. I mean, the range is incredible." 
</Person1><Person2> "Don't forget the 'Small Boat Satellite Gateway' –  using ESP32-C3 and Beidou-2?  This guy is thinking globally!  Um, you know, what I find especially intriguing is his commitment to open source and continuous learning. He’s even got his own website with automated deployment using Jenkins. Pretty savvy."  
</Person2><Person1> "I see. Interesting.  And those awards! National IoT Design Competition, Embedded System Competition... this guy's clearly a winner. But I have to question… that “Small Boat Satellite Gateway” – what kind of data processing are we talking about with that system combined with the large model interactions? Seems a bit… vague?"
</Person1><Person2> "Good point! Maybe we're missing some context there.  However,  his other projects seem well-documented. The fact he manages lab servers and helps with CUDA deployment also speaks volumes about his practical skills." 
</Person2><Person1> "True enough.  And let's not forget the hobbies.  Soft routing, game servers, PCB design, 3D printing, photography… It seems like if he's not coding, he's building or creating something. That kind of passion is infectious!"
</Person1><Person2> "Absolutely. And fluent in English, Cantonese, and Mandarin?  This Chen Zhanpeng is the whole package!  Any company would be lucky to have him." 
</Person2><Person1> "Couldn't agree more.  Well, listeners, that's Chen Zhanpeng, a truly impressive candidate.  We're out of time for today, but thanks for joining us on PODCASTIFY!  Until next time, keep innovating!" </Person1>
